Once upon a time I realized that cooking was one of the only things outside of work and friends that really gave me a sense of satisfaction. It was also all I could talk about.

This blog is an effort to get recipes out of my head (and photos off of my hard drive) and hopefully inspire some people to cook along the way. 

I also built this blog with GitHub pages and Jekyll. In the off chance that you want to see how, you can check out the source code here:
